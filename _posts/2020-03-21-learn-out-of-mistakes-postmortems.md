Some time ago, I wrote about how to build a company's culture based on human values, and mentioned a bunch of ideas that I would like to bring back:

- **Understand we make mistakes:** there are always good intentions but we are human beings and we are not perfect.
- **No finger pointing:** learn out of failure and create retrospectives in order to not repeat those failures again, but please do not blame people, we are always together either in the good moments and when going through difficulties.
- **Be positive:** there is always light at the end of the tunnel.

As we can see, these ideas reflect human behavior and attitudes against a problem, thus, I would like to take the opportunity to build on them and explore how we can 
leverage failures in order to learn from them. Let's get started!
